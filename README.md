# Energy Consumption Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
A professional Excel-based analytics solution designed to monitor and manage energy consumption across various building types and locations. This dashboard transforms raw consumption data into actionable insights for optimizing energy usage, identifying cost-saving opportunities, and supporting data-driven decision-making.

## Key Challenges
- Effectively monitor and manage energy consumption across various building types and locations
- Identify trends, anomalies, and opportunities for improvement in energy usage
- Ensure efficient operations and cost-effectiveness for energy resources

## Analytical Solution

### Methodology
I designed a comprehensive Excel dashboard featuring dedicated analysis for water, electricity, and gas consumption. Each section provides a deep dive into:

**Consumption Patterns**: Analyzed usage trends across buildings and timeframes to identify potential outliers and seasonal variations. For instance, water consumption spikes during summer months prompted investigation into irrigation practices or leak detection efforts.

**Cost Analysis**: Tracked yearly costs and identified areas for potential savings. Explored cost breakdowns by energy type and building to pinpoint areas with the highest spending. This revealed opportunities for energy-efficient upgrades or negotiations with suppliers.

**Interactive Features**: Implemented slicers and filters for user-driven exploration. Empowered users to compare consumption patterns across different building types, locations, and timeframes. This allowed for targeted analysis and identification of buildings with consistently high consumption rates.

### Technical Implementation
**Power Query**: Utilized Power Query's robust data cleansing and transformation capabilities to extract, clean, and transform raw data from separate tables into a unified and usable format for seamless analysis. This ensured data accuracy and consistency for reliable insights.

**Data Modeling**: Established relationships between tables using relevant columns to create a well-structured data model. This facilitated efficient data exploration and minimized the risk of errors in calculations and visualizations.

**Excel Formulas & Calculations**: Created custom calculations to determine key performance indicators (KPIs) critical for energy analysis. These included total cost, unit consumption by energy type, percentage breakdowns, and efficiency ratios like cost per unit consumed.

**Data Visualization**: Designed interactive charts and graphs using Excel's visualization tools to communicate complex energy consumption data clearly and concisely. Employed conditional formatting strategically to highlight anomalies and areas requiring further investigation.

## Actionable Results

**Water as the Dominant Resource**: Identified water as the dominant resource, accounting for 88.49% of total energy consumption. While water consumption fluctuated across years, the overall cost remained stable. This suggests potential for conservation efforts without significantly impacting the budget.

**Decreasing Gas Consumption and Costs**: Discovered a downward trend in gas consumption and costs from 2016 to 2019. This positive development necessitated further investigation into:
- Policy changes promoting energy efficiency
- Building renovations or infrastructure upgrades
- Shifts toward alternative energy sources

**Need for Additional Data Points**: The analysis revealed the benefit of incorporating building types and locations for a more holistic understanding, enabling:
- Benchmarking energy consumption patterns of similar building types
- Geographic analysis to identify correlations with weather patterns or regional infrastructure differences
- Targeted conservation strategies for specific regions

## Impact
This dashboard empowers organizations to make data-driven decisions that promote sustainable energy practices, optimize resource allocation, and achieve cost savings. By leveraging advanced Excel capabilities and analytical skills, this solution provides a foundation for more efficient energy management and supports strategic planning for energy conservation initiatives.
